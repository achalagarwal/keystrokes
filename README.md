# Keyboard Analytics

For the lack of a better name


## What is this?

This is a repository for analytics on your keyboard logging data. We plan to provide support for identity verification, typing analysis and insights, predictive typing, 
and most importantly provide a way for you to extend the provided streams to build your own utilities

## Where can this be used?

It can be used wherever we have keystroke data being logged, it doesn't require the timestamp information as that can take a huge performance hit on most machines.

## Why do I use it?

Everyday, we use our computer for long hours and this generates a ton of data. We can all make good use of that data for self-improvement.

## A philosophical "Why this project?"

Over the years, computing has made great strides but one thing that we have lagged behind is in interaction. We still have for the most part a mouse and a keyboard setup which isn't going to change anytime soon. This project aims to improve our HCI by leveraging the keyboard better.
The project could soon be predicting key changes to the user based on their typing analysis and also assisting them with typing better.

## How can I contribute?

This project is just starting out and any contribution big or small goes a long way in ensuring that we succeed together!
